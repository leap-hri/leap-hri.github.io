KEYNOTES

- [Pablo Barros](Pablo.Barros@sony.com), *Sony R&D Center, Brussels*
{% include figure.html img="PabloBarros.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Pablo Barros is a machine learning scientist working at Sony R & D Center in Brussels, focusing on physiological and social signal processing applied to mental health solutions. Pablo holds a Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Hamburg, in Germany, and over the last years, has worked on different projects involving social robotics and affective computing. In particular, his research focuses on social perception, in particular facial expression recognition, but also on modelling, based on artificial intelligence, the role of social agents while interacting with humans.
 

- [Dorsa Sadigh](dorsa@cs.stanford.edu), *Stanford University, USA*
{% include figure.html img="dorsa.png" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Dorsa Sadigh is an assistant professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.  Her research interests lie in the intersection of robotics, learning, and control theory. Specifically, she is interested in developing algorithms for safe and adaptive human-robot and human-AI interaction. Dorsa received her doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2017, and received her bachelor’s degree in EECS from UC Berkeley in 2012.  She is awarded the Sloan Fellowship, NSF CAREER, ONR Young Investigator Award, AFOSR Young Investigator Award, DARPA Young Faculty Award, Okawa Foundation Fellowship, MIT TR35, and the IEEE RAS Early Academic Career Award.
 
                
PANELISTS

- [Brian Scassellati](brian.scassellati@yale.edu), *University of Yale*
{% include figure.html img="scaz.jpeg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Brian Scassellati is a Professor of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Mechanical Engineering at Yale University and Director of the NSF Expedition on Socially Assistive Robotics. His research focuses on building embodied computational models of human social behavior, especially the developmental progression of early social skills. Using computational modeling and socially interactive robots, his research evaluates models of how infants acquire social skills and assists in the diagnosis and quantification of disorders of social development (such as autism). His other interests include humanoid robots, human-robot interaction, artificial intelligence, machine perception, and social learning. Dr. Scassellati received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001. His dissertation work (Foundations for a Theory of Mind for a Humanoid Robot) with Rodney Brooks used models drawn from developmental psychology to build a primitive system for allowing robots to understand people. His work at MIT focused mainly on two well-known humanoid robots named Cog and Kismet. He also holds a Master of Engineering in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (1995), and Bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (1995) and Brain and Cognitive Science (1995), all from MIT.

- [Séverin Lemaignan](severin.lemaignan@pal-robotics.com), *Pal Robotics, Spain*
{% include figure.html img="SeverinLemaignan.jpeg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Since 2021, Dr. Séverin Lemaignan has been Senior Scientist at Barcelona-based PAL Robotics. He leads the Social Intelligence team, in charge of designing and developing the socio-cognitive capabilities of robots such as TIAGo and ARI. He was previously Associate Professor in Social Robotics and AI at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, University of the West of England, Bristol. He obtained a joint PhD in Cognitive Robotics from CNRS/LAAS (France) and the Technical University of Munich (Germany) in 2012. He then joined the EPFL (Switzerland) and Plymouth University (UK) as post-doc, then lecturer in Robotics until 2018, when he joined the Bristol Robotics Lab. His research interest primarily concerns the socio-cognitive aspects of human-robot interaction and he has focused his recent experimental work on child-robot interaction and human-in-the-loop machine learning for social robots. Séverin Lemaignan has been involved in several European projects related to social and cognitive robotics (SPRING, SHAPES, DREAM,…) and was awarded in 2015 a EU H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for his project on robots and theory of mind.
