Mariacarla Staffa is an Assistant Professor in Human-Robot Interaction, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Robotics at the Department of Science and Technologies of the University of Naples Parthenope, Italy. She received her M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the University Federico II with honors, in 2008. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Automation Engineering from the University Federico II in 2011. She was a visiting researcher at the Institute de Système Intelligentes et de Robotique of the University of Paris Pierre et Marie Curie. She is a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and of the EUCognition - European Society for Cognitive Systems (ID: 2037). She is also part of the IEEE RAS Technical Committee for Cognitive Robotics. She serves as an Expert Reviewer for the European Commission Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Area: AI and Robotics). She is mainly interested in exploring computational neuroscience and cognitive robotics to generate innovative strategies and solutions for scientific problems and technological limitations. She authored several works on Social Assistive Robots, Adaptive Human-Robot Interaction, Human Behavior and Emotion interpretation, etc. She has been the Project Manager for one year of the H2020-MSCA-ITN project PERSEO – European training network on PErsonalized Robotics as SErvice Oriented applications. She is currently working on BCI-based interface in HRI, for emotional and cognitive monitoring, assessment, and control.
