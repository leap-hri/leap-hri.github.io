Vincenzo Lomonaco is an Assistant Professor at the University of Pisa, Italy and Co-Founding President of ContinualAI, a non-profit research organization and the largest open community on Continual Learning for AI. He also serves as a Co-founder and Board Member of AI for People, Director of the ContinualAI Lab and a proud member of the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)


- [Ginevra Castellano](), *Uppsala University, Sweden*
{% include figure.html img="ginevra-cropped.png" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Ginevra Castellano is a Professor in Intelligent Interactive Systems at the Department of Information Technology of Uppsala University, Sweden, where she leads the Uppsala Social Robotics Lab.

Her research interests are in the area of intelligent interactive systems, and include social robotics, human-robot interaction and affective computing.

The natural testbeds for this research are socially assistive scenarios where robots provide not only physical, but also social support to humans, where robotic technologies have the potential to bring benefits to the society we live in, for example in application areas such as education and assistive technology, by enhancing the lives of children and other groups that require specialised support and intervention.


PANELISTS

- [Sam Barrett](), *Sony AI*
{% include figure.html img="SamBarrett.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Sam joined Sony AI in 2019 as a senior research scientist, when Sony AI acquired Cogitai. Sam works on combining artificial intelligence and games using reinforcement learning. He previously worked at Amazon Robotics using AI to improve the performance of the robotics system inside Amazon's warehouses. He received his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Texas at Austin in October 2014. His dissertation examined the problem of ad hoc teamwork and cooperating with unknown teammates by exploiting previously learned knowledge. In addition, he helped the UT Austin Villa team win the 2012 international RoboCup competition in the standard platform league (SPL). Before joining UT, Sam received his B.S. in computer science from Stevens Institute of Technology in May 2008.

- [Natasha Jaques](), *Google / UC Berkeley*
{% include figure.html img="natasha.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Natasha Jaques holds a joint position as a Senior Research Scientist at Google Brain and Visiting Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley. Her research focuses on Social Reinforcement Learning in multi-agent and human-AI interactions. Natasha completed her PhD at MIT, where her thesis received the Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award from the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing. Her work has also received Best Demo at NeurIPS, an honourable mention for Best Paper at ICML, Best of Collection in the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, and Best Paper at the NeurIPS workshops on ML for Healthcare and Cooperative AI. She has interned at DeepMind, Google Brain, and was an OpenAI Scholars mentor. Her work has been featured in Science Magazine, Quartz, IEEE Spectrum, MIT Technology Review, Boston Magazine, and on CBC radio. Natasha earned her Masters degree from the University of British Columbia, and undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Psychology from the University of Regina.

- [Kate Darling](), *MIT Media Lab*
{% include figure.html img="kate-cropped.png" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Dr. Kate Darling is a Research Specialist at the MIT Media Lab and author of The New Breed: What Our History with Animals Reveals about Our Future with Robots. Her interest is in how technology intersects with society. Kateâ€™s current work looks at the near-term effects of robotic technology, with a particular interest in law, social, and ethical issues. She has also explored economic issues in intellectual property systems. She runs experiments, holds workshops, writes, and speaks about some of the more interesting developments in the world of human-robot interaction, and where we might find ourselves in the future.
