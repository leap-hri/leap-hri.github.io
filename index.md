While most of the research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) focus on short-term interactions, long-term interactions require "bolder" developments and a substantial amount of resources, especially if therobots are deployed "in the wild". The robots need to incrementally learn new concepts or abilities (i.e.,"lifelong learning") to adapt their behaviors within new situations and personalize their interactions withusers to maintain their interest and engagement.

The "Lifelong Learning and Personalization in Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction (LEAP-HRI)" workshop aims to address the developments and challenges in these areas and create a medium for researchers to share their work in progress, present preliminary results, learn from the experience of invited researchers and discuss relevant topics. The workshop extends the topics covered in the "Personalization in Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction (PLOT-HRI)" workshop at HRI 2019 and “Lifelong Learning for Long-term Human-Robot Interaction (LL4LHRI)” workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2020, and focuses on studies on lifelong learning and adaptivity to users, context, environment, and tasks in long-term interactions in a variety of fields (e.g., education, rehabilitation, elderly care, collaborative tasks, customer-oriented service and companion robots).
