- [Bahar Irfan](mailto:bahar.irfan@plymouth.ac.uk), *University of Plymouth, UK*. 
{% include figure.html img="bahar-irfan.jpg" alt="Bahar Irfan" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Bahar Irfan is an Early-Stage Researcher and a PhD candidate at the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems, University of Plymouthand SoftBank Robotics Europe, France, in the joint Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN project APRIL. Her work focuses on multi-modal personalization in long-term human-robot interaction, which involves incremental and online learning of users, their behaviours and preferences in customer-oriented service and socially assistive robotics domains.


- [Aditi Ramachandran](mailto:aditi@myvanrobot.com.), *Vän Robotics, USA*
{% include figure.html img="aditi-ramachandran.png" alt="Aditi Ramachandran" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Aditi Ramachandran is the Chief Robot Officer at Van Robotics where she works on building educational robots and oversees all software development at the company. She received a PhD from the Social Robotics Lab at Yale University where her research focused on personalized social robot tutors for children.

- [Samuel Spaulding](http://www.samspaulding.com/), *MIT Media Lab, USA*
{% include figure.html img="sam-spaulding.jpeg" alt="Samuel Spaulding" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Samuel Spaulding is a PhD student in the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab. His thesis research is focusing on building robots that can learn personalized cognitive and affective models of users over repeated interactions and across different tasks.

- [Hatice Gunes](), University of Cambridge, UK, Hatice.Gunes@cl.cam.ac.uk. 
{% include figure.html img="anon.png" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Dr. Gunes is a Reader in Affective Intelligence and Robotics (AFAR) and the Director of the AFAR Lab at the University of Cam-bridge. Her expertise is in the areas of affective computing and social signal processing cross-fertilizing research in multimodal interaction, computer vision, machine learning and social robotics. She has published over 100 papers in these areas (H-index=32, citations > 5,000) and her research highlights include Best Paper Candidate at IEEE RO-MAN’20, Outstanding Paper Award at IEEE FG’11 and Best Demo Award at IEEE ACII’09. Dr Gunes is the former President of the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing, the General Co-Chair of ACII 2019, and the Program Co-Chair of ACM/IEEE HRI 2020 and IEEE FG 2017.
